# Bengaluru House Price Prediction
To import and clean the data of bangalore house prices. Then build a model upon it to predict new prices.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Bengaluru using various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, etc. The objective is to build a predictive model that can provide accurate price estimates for houses in Bengaluru.

## Data Collection
- Gathered data from various sources such as real estate websites, government property databases, and local real estate agencies.
- Data includes historical housing prices, property details, location information, and economic indicators from kaggle -https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data .

## Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Normalized or standardized the data as needed.
- Encoded categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

## Feature Selection and Engineering
- Identified key features influencing house prices.
- Created new features, such as price per square foot and proximity to amenities.

## Model Selection
- Chose appropriate models for the prediction task including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines, and neural networks.
- Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- Trained models using the training data.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Performed cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
